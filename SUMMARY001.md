# SlopeShift Project Summary

## Overview
SlopeShift is a modular, multi-tenant platform built with Next.js, Prisma, and Supabase. It supports dynamic module access per client, a robust admin portal, and a modern, responsive UI.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Tenancy (Single Database)
- All main tables are scoped by `clientId`.
- Each client can have access to a custom set of modules.
- All API endpoints enforce `clientId` scoping and module access.

### 2. Modular Architecture
- Modules (e.g., Staff, Housing, Shifts, Forms, etc.) are defined in a `Module` table.
- The `ClientModule` join table links clients to their enabled modules.
- The frontend dynamically shows/hides modules in the sidebar and UI based on allowed modules.

### 3. Admin Portal
- Internal `/admin` portal for superadmins to:
  - List all clients
  - Edit client info
  - Enable/disable modules for each client
- Admin portal is protected by module access (only users with the `Admin` module can access).

### 4. Dynamic Sidebar & UI
- Sidebar navigation is dynamically filtered based on allowed modules for the current client.
- Uses a custom React hook (`useAllowedModules`) to fetch and store allowed modules.

### 5. Backend API
- All API routes are in `app/api/` and use Next.js route handlers.
- Each route uses utility functions to extract `clientId` and check module access.
- Admin API endpoints for managing clients and modules:
  - `GET /api/admin/clients` — List all clients
  - `GET /api/admin/clients/[id]` — Get client details
  - `PUT /api/admin/clients/[id]` — Update client info
  - `GET /api/admin/modules` — List all modules
  - `GET /api/admin/clients/[id]/modules` — List enabled modules for a client
  - `PUT /api/admin/clients/[id]/modules` — Update enabled modules for a client

### 6. Prisma & Database
- Prisma schema updated for multi-tenancy and modular access.
- Models: `Client`, `Module`, `ClientModule`, and all main app models with `clientId`.
- Seed script creates demo data for stress testing.

### 7. Frontend
- Next.js 14+ app directory structure.
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
- All pages and modals updated for multi-tenancy.
- Admin portal UI for managing clients and modules.

### 8. DevOps & Git
- `.gitattributes` file added for consistent line endings.
- Git history cleaned and reset to avoid large/binary files.

## Technical Specs

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) via Prisma ORM
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **UI:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Authentication:** (Pluggable, not yet fully implemented)
- **API:** Next.js Route Handlers (app/api/)
- **State Management:** React Context/hooks (for allowed modules)

## Completed Work

- Multi-tenancy schema and logic (Prisma, API, frontend)
- Modular access control (backend and frontend)
- Dynamic sidebar and UI based on allowed modules
- Admin portal (backend endpoints and frontend UI)
- Seed script for demo data
- Cleaned up git history and added `.gitattributes`
- Error handling and troubleshooting for build and runtime issues
- Guidance for best practices in code, git, and deployment

---

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Integrate real authentication/session for `clientId` and admin access
- Enhance admin UI (search, pagination, better error handling)
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Production deployment and environment hardening
