# SlopeShift Project Summary

## Overview
SlopeShift is a modular, multi-tenant platform built with Next.js, Prisma, and Supabase. It supports dynamic module access per client, a robust admin portal, and a modern, responsive UI.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Tenancy (Single Database)
- All main tables are scoped by `clientId`.
- Each client can have access to a custom set of modules.
- All API endpoints enforce `clientId` scoping and module access.

### 2. Modular Architecture
- Modules (e.g., Staff, Housing, Shifts, Forms, etc.) are defined in a `Module` table.
- The `ClientModule` join table links clients to their enabled modules.
- The frontend dynamically shows/hides modules in the sidebar and UI based on allowed modules.

### 3. Admin Portal
- Internal `/admin` portal for superadmins to:
  - List all clients
  - Edit client info
  - Enable/disable modules for each client
- Admin portal is protected by module access (only users with the `Admin` module can access).

### 4. Dynamic Sidebar & UI
- Sidebar navigation is dynamically filtered based on allowed modules for the current client.
- Uses a custom React hook (`useAllowedModules`) to fetch and store allowed modules.

### 5. Backend API
- All API routes are in `app/api/` and use Next.js route handlers.
- Each route uses utility functions to extract `clientId` and check module access.
- Admin API endpoints for managing clients and modules:
  - `GET /api/admin/clients` — List all clients
  - `GET /api/admin/clients/[id]` — Get client details
  - `PUT /api/admin/clients/[id]` — Update client info
  - `GET /api/admin/modules` — List all modules
  - `GET /api/admin/clients/[id]/modules` — List enabled modules for a client
  - `PUT /api/admin/clients/[id]/modules` — Update enabled modules for a client

### 6. Prisma & Database
- Prisma schema updated for multi-tenancy and modular access.
- Models: `Client`, `Module`, `ClientModule`, and all main app models with `clientId`.
- Seed script creates demo data for stress testing.

### 7. Frontend
- Next.js 14+ app directory structure.
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
- All pages and modals updated for multi-tenancy.
- Admin portal UI for managing clients and modules.

### 8. DevOps & Git
- `.gitattributes` file added for consistent line endings.
- Git history cleaned and reset to avoid large/binary files.

## Technical Specs

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) via Prisma ORM
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **UI:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Authentication:** (Pluggable, not yet fully implemented)
- **API:** Next.js Route Handlers (app/api/)
- **State Management:** React Context/hooks (for allowed modules)
- **Admin Portal:** Internal, module-protected, at `/admin`

---

## Completed Work

- Multi-tenancy schema and logic (Prisma, API, frontend)
- Modular access control (backend and frontend)
- Dynamic sidebar and UI based on allowed modules
- Admin portal (backend endpoints and frontend UI)
- Seed script for demo data
- Cleaned up git history and added `.gitattributes`
- Error handling and troubleshooting for build and runtime issues
- Guidance for best practices in code, git, and deployment

---

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Integrate real authentication/session for `clientId` and admin access
- Enhance admin UI (search, pagination, better error handling)
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Production deployment and environment hardening

## Recent Accomplishments (Latest Session)

- **Defensive Coding for Data Rendering:**
  - Updated all main pages (Tickets, Passes, Guests, Rentals, Lessons) to defensively check that API data is an array before calling `.map`, preventing runtime errors when API responses are malformed or empty.
  - Ensured robust user experience even when impersonating or when backend data is missing/corrupt.

- **Impersonation & Client Context:**
  - Fully tested and validated the impersonation feature for SlopeShift admins.
  - When impersonating, the app sets `localStorage.clientId` and redirects to `/dashboard`.
  - A clear banner is shown on all main app pages during impersonation, with a button to stop impersonating and return to the admin portal.

- **Admin Portal Polish:**
  - Improved dark mode readability and UI consistency in the admin portal and main app.
  - Ensured admin API endpoints do not require or check for `clientId` after refactor.
  - Admin portal now reliably allows SlopeShift staff to manage clients, modules, and impersonate clients for support/debugging.

- **Troubleshooting & Fixes:**
  - Resolved internal server errors caused by corrupted build artifacts by cleaning and rebuilding.
  - Fixed Prisma client import and seed script issues by converting to JavaScript and using defensive upserts.
  - Addressed hydration errors and missing API calls by correcting `clientId` logic in admin endpoints.
  - Provided guidance for handling Git line ending warnings and best practices for `.gitattributes`.

- **User Experience:**
  - Successfully tested all main flows: impersonation, module access, admin management, and defensive rendering.
  - Ensured the app is robust, testable, and maintainable for further development.

## Recent Accomplishments (Post-Previous Summary)

- **Restored dynamic, client-specific sidebar:** Sidebar now shows modules based on client assignment, using a new module config and the useAllowedModules hook. Admins see a fixed set of links.
- **Restored and aligned SlopeShift logo:** Logo appears at the top of the sidebar, aligned with the dashboard top bar.
- **Made impersonation banner full-width:** Banner now stretches across the entire screen above sidebar and content.
- **Isolated landing page from app layout:** Moved sidebar/topbar layout to a dedicated file and wrapped only app pages (like dashboard) in it, so the landing page loads all sections and is unaffected by app layout.
- **Fixed landing page footer:** Legal section now appears to the right of Resources by updating the grid to lg:grid-cols-6 and ensuring correct column spans/order.
- **General UI/UX polish:** Ensured all changes are visually consistent and robust across admin, client, and landing experiences.
